Adding Classes and Structuring Your Project
Create New Classes:

Add new classes for different functionalities, such as data models, business logic, or utility functions.
Organize into Folders:

Create folders within your project to organize classes. For example, a Models folder for data models, a ViewModels folder for view models, and a Views folder for additional XAML files.
ViewModel:

Implement the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for better separation of concerns. Create view models to manage the data and logic of your views.
